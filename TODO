- Add some methods to query / extract / clean the DB cache
- Allow mutating an `Extent` class (expand size and/or translate)
- Change the `Extent` API so that the `zoom` is calculated dynamically:
   - Fixes the nasty "mutate while we do this" pattern is `plot`
   - Allows more easily changing the extent dynamically
   - We should also pass in the requested pixel sizes...
- More tests!
