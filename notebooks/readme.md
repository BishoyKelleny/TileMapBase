# Notebooks

Some Jupyter notebooks.

- [Example](Example.ipynb) - A simple example of the package.
- [With geopandas](With geopandas.ipynb) - An example of integration with geopandas
- [Wards in Leeds](Wards in Leeds.ipynb) - A quasi-realistic example of getting some open data and displaying it; uses `requests` and `geopandas`.

Of further interest:

- [Projections](Projections.ipynb) - Quick explaination of the map projection which web mapping tiles use.
- [Imshow Filters](Imshow%20Filters.ipynb) - Shows how the different `matplotlib` `imshow` interpolation methods look.
